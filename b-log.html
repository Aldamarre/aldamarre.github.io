            <p>i just realized that the cover image for the media play on the home page doesnt show, checked it out and
                it seems to be a 404 error for the site that the img is linked to. I'll take it as a sign to update the
                music</p>

            <p>started on the myStuff and the music tab, its been verrry annoying to implement stuff because i was side

            <p>also I did say I would change out the website msuic and I should finish making the myStuff folder so my
                website can be at least 95% complete</p>

            <p>Many stressful things have been crossing my mind the past few days. Still, I'm trying to focus on
                learning my guitar after coming home from school, and I've been drawing more. I'm not the best artist,
                but I want to invest in that skill so I can post it here. Maybe posting my progress may give me an
                incentive to be better. I wonder how much better I'll be by graduation next year.</p>

            <p>idk if the character design board in myPins folder is a bad thing since its a pinterest board of peoples
                art, which i do not take credit for at all. its only meant to be for reference and inspiration cuz and i
                wanted share it to anyone who's interested in character design</p>
