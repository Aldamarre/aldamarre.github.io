                <p>WHATS UP YOUTUBE TUBE TUBE TUBE TUUUUUUUUUBE! its been a while but i finally added a "darkmode" feautre to my site. You will find it in the tab-bar accross all of my pages. it was done using filer:invert, it seems to run well enough but my friends do notice that it lags the site when hardware accelerateration isnt on, but hey now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ at least you know how fix it now if it looks dookie. i also noticed that i cant change how it effects 3rd party iframes like chatango which i use for myChat. im probably will have to use a guestbook or make and host my own chat....we will see

            <p>Merry christmas! this christmas break has been mid if im being honest. But that doesnt mean i cant try to
                make a good website. Ive been looking at many peoples sites for inspo and i realize that site lack true
                personality. I want to incorperate more color palettes and be more curious about different website
                aesthetics. In due time I want to incorperate a desktopcore aesthetic. That will be a good challenge and
                the second phase of my project. Oh-(i just thought of this while i was typing) for inspo one themes i
                should look at monkeytype.com, they have a large array of themes to choose from. thats it for now ya'll.
                Once again MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!</p>

            <p>Ive been doing some updates to the a the myPins, theres has been this problem when I open the page the
                first board looks good but the rest are enlarged. It seems like this was happeninng because of how they
                were being loaded in, soooo fixed. Now I want to to make the music my stuff like to their respective
                videos on youtube.</p>

            <p>i just realized that the cover image for the media play on the home page doesnt show, checked it out and
                it seems to be a 404 error for the site that the img is linked to. I'll take it as a sign to update the

            <p>Many stressful things have been crossing my mind the past few days. Still, I'm trying to focus on
                learning my guitar after coming home from school, and I've been drawing more. I'm not the best artist,
                but I want to invest in that skill so I can post it here. Maybe posting my progress may give me an
                incentive to be better. I wonder how much better I'll be by graduation next year.</p>
