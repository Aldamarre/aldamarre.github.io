        <p>Many stressful things have been crossing my mind the past few days. Still, I'm trying to focus on learning my guitar after coming home from school, and I've been drawing more. I'm not the best artist, but I want to invest in that skill so I can post it here. Maybe posting my progress may give me an incentive to be better. I wonder how much better I'll be by graduation next year.</p>
