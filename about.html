            <p>As of this writing, I'm in my junior year of university. I made this website because I was lost. I wanted to get an SWE job but realized my skills and passion were lacking.</p>
            <p>I've decided to set aside this ambition for a more peaceful path in IT, only because you'd get hired a lot quicker in IT.</p>
            <p>With the tremendous weight of my expectations lifted from my shoulders, I've found the time to enjoy learning and having fun implementing what I've learned.</p>
            <p>This website is my little corner of the internet. It won’t always look the same, because I’m constantly improving it and adding new stuff.</p> 
            <p>But beyond just being a tech project, it’s also going to be a space where I express myself, whether that’s through sharing thoughts, art, music, reading, or a bit of programming.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy watching me improve!</p>
